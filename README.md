Learning to use desktop gitbash 

The first thing I learned was to clone. Clone is simple, just copy repositry link and paset it in termainal with git. syntax is -> git clone link(repository link)
Now Im going to save the cahnges and learn the next command
to check status I of your file go to termianal got right directory and write git status. It will show if there are any modification made to it. At this point the modificattions are made but not commited yet.
To commit we have an argumnet "-a" syntax is -> git commit -a, to add any knd of messgae along with it we have a command with "-m" syntax -> git commit -a -m "Your message here"
