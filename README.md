# Learning-Gitbash
Learning to use desktop gitbash 

The first thing I learned was to clone. Clone is simple, just copy repositry link and paset it in termainal with git. syntax is -> git clone link(repository link)
Now Im going to save the cahnges and learn the next command
to check status I of your file go to termianal got right directory and write git status. It will show if there are any modification made to it. At this point the modificattions are made but not commited yet.
To commit we have an argumnet "-a" syntax is -> git commit -a, to add any knd of messgae along with it we have a command with "-m" syntax -> git commit -a -m "Your message here"
to check hwhat changes have been made to project command is "log" syntax -> git log-2 (- 2 is nu,ber of times of commit)
Push and Pull, whatever the changes we made and commits we did are still locally stored in our laptop and havent been pushed (send) to github and the project
To push the commit we need to know the remote place first, syntax -> git remote and it tells us the origin 
Now to push the commit syntax -> git push origin master (master is the brnach where we want to push)
